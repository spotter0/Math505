\section{Introduction}
Our work focuses on the study of elliptic curves over finite fields, $\F_p$. With the recent prevalence of elliptic curves used in cryptography, there is naturally much work being done to understand their subtleties. In 1985, the use of elliptic curves in cryptography was independently suggested by Neal Koblitz and Victor S. Miller. It was not until 2004 that elliptic curve cryptography algorithms became widely used. \\\\
Our current focus is, as mentioned above, properties of elliptic curves over $\F_p$. We have asked how many singular/non-singular curves exist over finite fields of order $p$ for $p$ a prime number, what are the restrictions on coefficients $a,b$ for curves of the form $y^2=x^3+ax+b$ so that the resulting curve is isomorphic to $\Z_m\times\Z_n$ for $m,n$ odd primes, and whether it is possible to find primes $p_1$ and $p_2$ with corresponding elliptic curves $E_1$, $E_2$ such that $\left|E\left(\F_{p_1}\right)\right|=\left|E\left(\F_{p_2}\right)\right|$. 

\section{Introduction to Elliptic Curves}
\begin{definition}
An \textbf{elliptic curve} is a planar curve defined by an equation of the form \begin{align*}
y^2=x^3+ax+b
\end{align*}
that is \textbf{non-singular}, that is its graph has no cusps or self-intersections. The form above is called a \textbf{Weierstrass equation}.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
The \textbf{discriminant} of an elliptic curve,
\begin{align*}
\Delta=-16\left(4a^3+27b^2\right)
\end{align*}
determines if the curve is non-singular. That is, a given curve is non-singular if and only if the discriminant is non-zero. The graph of a non-singular elliptic curve has two components if its discriminant is positive and one component if it is negative.
\end{definition}

\subsection{Elliptic Curve Group Law}
The set of points on a particular elliptic curve, $G$, has a natural interpretation as a group. When working in the projective plane, we can define a group structure on any smooth, cubic curve.\\\\
In Weierstrass normal form, such a curve will have an additional point at infinity $O$, at the homogeneous coordinates $[0:1:0]$ which serves as the identity of the group.

\begin{definition}
We define the binary operation $\oplus$ as follows. For $P,Q$ two points on the curve, $P\oplus Q$ is found by first drawing a line between $P$ and $Q$. This will generally intersect the cubic at a third point, $R$. We then take $P\oplus Q=-R$, the point opposite $R$.
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}
The binary operation $\oplus$ on $E(k)$ for some field $k$ such that for points $P,Q,R$ on $E$:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $P\oplus Q=Q\oplus P$
\item $P\oplus O=P$
\item If a line $L$ meets $E$ at points $P,Q,R$, then $(P\oplus Q)\oplus R=O$
\item Given $P\in E(k)$, there exists $R\in E(k)$ such that $P\oplus R=O$
\item $(P\oplus Q)\oplus R=P\oplus(Q\oplus R)$
\end{enumerate}
Therefore, $(E(k),\oplus)$ is an Abelian group.
\end{proposition}

\begin{conjecture} (Spencer)\\
Let $p\equiv 1\mod 4$ and let $i\in\F_p$ be such that $i^2\equiv -1\mod p$. Then for the elliptic curve, $E$, defined as $y^2=x^2+ix$ over $\F_p$
\begin{enumerate}
\item If $p\equiv 1 \mod 8$, then $E\left(\F_p\right)\simeq\Z_n\oplus\Z_2$ where $n=\left|E\left(\F_p\right)\right|/2$.
\item If $p\equiv 5\mod 8$, then $E\left(\F_p\right)$ is cyclic.
\end{enumerate}
\end{conjecture}

\subsection{October 15, 2015 - Number of Curves over $\F_p$, $p$ prime}

\begin{definition} An algebraic curve is the set of points $(x_1,\dots,x_n)$ satisfying $f(x_1,\dots,x_n)=0$ where $f$ is a polynomial function $f:\mathbf{R}^n\to\mathbf{R}$. 
\end{definition}

\begin{definition} An algebraic curve is singular at a point if all of its partial derivatives vanish. In this case, the point is said to be a singular point and the curve is said to be a singular curve.
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma} If $$y^2=x^3+a_1x+b_1 \text{ and } y^2=x^3+a_2x+b_2,$$ then $a_1=a_2$ and $b_1=b_2$. In other words, there are exactly $p^2$ distinct elliptic curves in Weierstrass form: one for each choice of $a,b$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof} (Stephanie Potter)\\
Assume $x^3+a_1x+b_1=y^2=x^3+a_2x+b_2$. This requires that
$$a_1x+b_1=a_2x+b_2$$
for all $x$. We consider three cases:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Suppose $a_1=a_2$. Then in order to maintain $a_1x+b_1=a_1x+b_2$ for all $x$ requires that $b_1=b_2$.
\item Suppose $b_1=b_2$. Once again, in order to maintain $a_1x+b_1=a_2x+b_2$ for all $x$ requires that $a_1=a_2$.
\item With this, suppose $a_1\not=a_2$ and $b_1\not=b_2$. Then, $a_1x+b_1=a_2x+b_2$ is true only when $$x=\frac{b_2-b_1}{a_1-a_2}.$$
\end{enumerate}
Therefore, it is clear that we must have $a_1=a_2$ and $b_1=b_2$ and so there are exactly $p^2$ distinct elliptic curves, one for each choice of $a$ and $b$.
\end{proof}

\begin{conjecture}
Over the finite field $\F_p$, $p$ an odd prime, there exist $p$ singular elliptic curves in Weierstrass form.
\end{conjecture}

\begin{proof} (Ian Cavey)\\
The curve $y^2=x^3+ax+b$ is singular if and only if the polynomial $x^3+ax+b$ has a double root. To see this, define the algebraic curve $$f(x,y)=y^2-x^3-ax-b.$$ The partial derivatives are $$f_x(x,y)=-3x^2-a\hspace{2ex}\text{and}\hspace{2ex}f_y(x,y)=2y.$$ A point $(x_1,y_1)$ on the elliptic curve is a singular point of $f$ if and only if  $y_1=0$ and $3x_1^2+a=0$. Since, $(x_1,y_1)$ is on the curve, it also satisfies the original equation, i.e., $x_1^3+ax_1+b=0$. $x_1$ is a root of $x^3+ax+b$ and its derivative, so $x_1$ must be a root with multiplicity at least 2 of $x^3+ax+b$. Explicitly, $(x-x_1)^2|(x^3+ax+b)$.

Carrying out the long division $$(x-x_1)^2 \hspace{1ex}\big)\hspace{-.8ex}\overline{\hspace{1ex}x^3+ax+b}$$ one can find that the remainder is $(a+3x_1^2)x+(b-2x_1^3)$. One has divisibility if and only if the remainder is zero. Therefore the curve $y^2=x^3+ax+b$ has a singular point at $(x_1,y_1)$ if and only if $a=-3x_1^2$, $b=2x_1^3$, and $y_1=0$. Note that an elliptic curve cannot have two distinct singular points, because that would imply that there are distinct $x_1,x_2$ such that both $(x-x_1)^2$ and $(x-x_2)^2$ divide $x^3+ax+b$. This is impossible because then $(x-x_1)^2(x-x_2)^2$ would divide $x^3+ax+b$, and a degree 4 polynomial cannot divide a degree 3 polynomial. Therefore, for each $x_1\in F_p$ there is a unique singular curve which has a singular point at $x=x_1$. Conversely, for every singular curve there is some $x_1$ such that there is a singular point at $x=x_1$ Therefore, we have a one-to-one correspondence between singular curves over $F_p$ and elements of $F_p$, so there are exactly $p$ singular curves over $F_p$. By Lemma 1, there are $p^2$ distinct elliptic curves over $F_p$. Since there are $p$ singular elliptic curves, there are $p^2-p$ nonsingular curves.
\end{proof}

\begin{conjecture}
Over $\F_p$, $p$ an odd prime, the number of curves of order $p+1-r$ is equivalent to the number of curves of order $p+1+r$ for all $r\in\Z$. 
\end{conjecture}

\begin{proof}

\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}(Hasse) For an elliptic curve $E$ defined over the finite field $\F_q$ of $q$ elements, the order of the group $E\left(\F_q\right)$ of $\F_q$-rational points is an integer in the Hasse interval
\begin{align*}
\hasse_q=\left[q+1-2\sqrt{q},q+1+2\sqrt{q}\right]
\end{align*}

\end{theorem}

\underline{Notes}: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item The second conjecture in this section seems more challenging to prove. As of now, we do not see how to do so but will continue working towards a proof.
\item The sage code used to develop these conjectures is listed in Dropbox under the Software folder. The worksheet is titled \emph{EllipticCurvesonFp.sagews}.

\subsection{October 24, 2015 - Group Meeting}
\underline{Notes}: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Monica has generated data in reference to last week's question: determine the possible orders for curves of the form $y^2=x^3+px\mod q$ with $p<q$ both prime. More data will be generated shortly.
\item We found John J. McGee's thesis on Schoof's algorithm. In this paper, determining orders of elliptic curves is described which we believe might be useful in proving Conjecture 10. This paper can be found in Dropbox under Literature.
\end{enumerate}

\underline{Questions/Conjectures}:
\begin{enumerate}
\item No point can be in two distinct curves of the same order. Unfortunately, we found a counterexample to this.
